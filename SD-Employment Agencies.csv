Our San Diego live scan location is conveniently located just off the 5 Freeway in Pacific Beach. So avoid delays which are typically caused by poor quality fingerprints taken by inexperienced live scan providers. When selecting a livescan service provider, it's also important to choose an experienced fingerprint roller to avoid rejections and lengthy delays. Whether you need live scan services for employment, certification or licensing purposes, you will find our electronic fingerprint service to be top notch and our customer service to be unsurpassed. Located just off the I-5 Freeway in Pacific Beach, our live scan location is convenient for anyone in Ocean Beach, Pt. Loma, La Jolla, Clairemont... as well as anyone else in San Diego. Many of our applicants are originally instructed to go to their local police department or sheriff office to be fingerprinted.

Our facility is often referred to by local police departments and sheriff offices.   Need the old fashion 'Ink Fingerprints'? We are also approved by the California Department of Justice for ink fingerprinting on the standard FBI FD-258 ink fingerprint card. People often find it difficult to obtain the required blue FD 258 hard card (aka 'Ten Print' or 'Ink Card'). Fortunately, Alive Scan provides these fingerprint cards 'FREE' to our customers! Some common 'hard card' ink fingerprint candidates include:  o Personal Criminal Background Check.  o Attorneys - (Record Reviews) To correct errors, expungement...  o Government and Federal Jobs.  o Teaching Abroad / Teaching Overseas.  o Traveling Nurse (RN).  o Financial Sector - required by the SEC & FINRA.  o Visa & Immigration.  o Police Clearance Certificate. In order to furnish an individual with a copy of their criminal record, or proof that one does not exist, the individual must be fingerprinted on the FD-258 form by an authorized fingerprint service provider. Alive Scan is a professional fingerprint facility located right here in San Diego, California 92109. The individual then mails the completed FD258 card to the FBI's CJIS Division for processing.
