The company is developing both medical devices as well as pharmaceutical agents to be used in important pathologies within the ophthalmology market. These areas include cataract detection, cataract surgery, glaucoma therapy and age-related macular degeneration. Advanced Refractive Technologies is now preparing to revolutionize the ophthalmic market with its use of water jet technology. Waterjet technology is an established method for precision cutting of materials in a variety of industrial applications. It uses the principle of pressurizing water to extremely high levels, and allowing the water to escape in a controlled manner through a very small opening, or orifice. ART also uses the Accupulse Cataract Emulsifier-an emulsification device designed for the quick and safe removal of the cataractous human crystalline lens in the eye, a necessary procedure before installing a new intraocular lens. The device creates a pulsating stream of saline solution, and the impact from the pulsating fluid emulsifies the cataractous human lens and breaks the lens into small pieces. The Accupulse simultaneously aspirates the emulsified tissue and removes it from the interior of the eye.

Founded by triathletes, Emilio De Soto and Dan Neyenhuis, the San Diego-based company leverages over 25 years of experience in international triathlon competition in every product it designs and creates, thereby selling the most innovative products used in this popular endurance sport. De Soto makes technical garments for men and women designed with comfort and style, most of which can be used for swimming, biking, and running, eliminating the need to change. De Soto also offers a complete line of workout apparel, accessories and gear all of which transcend well into many other sports and exercise. During the first year of business, De Soto shared an office and warehouse with Quintana Roo, which at the time was owned by Dan Empfield, the inventor of the triathlon wetsuit and triathlon-geometry bicycle, and more recently the triathlon news site Slowtwitch.com. Throughout the 1990's the majority of products designed by De Soto have become the original concept and basis for the products developed by competitors today. From the transition pack, to the trisuit and tri shorts with thin cycling pads, to tri jerseys with zippers, and run shorts with pockets...even the mesh running cap, were developed first by De Soto. In 2001, De Soto introduced the T1 Wetsuit, a revolutionary two-piece wetsuit designed not only to keep you warm in cold water, but also to correct your body position making swimming more efficient and faster. The two-piece concept allows a customer to buy a separate top and bottom to optimize proper fit. It also offers a modular method of purchasing pieces to either accommodate for varying water temperatures or simply to replace or upgrade to a newer model without having to buy a completely new wetsuit. The popularity of the T1 has grown progressively and is commonly referred to as the MAC of wetsuits in a PC world of one-piece wetsuits. De Soto remains the only company making a production two-piece wetsuit. The innovations continue to flow as new products are added to the T1 Wetsuit line each season. In 2004, the company moved to its current location, a 30 year old building the company bought and has remodeled on the inside with vibrant colors, soft lighting, fresh ocean breezes from sliding glass doors ( instead of air conditioning ), and a south facing balcony to enjoy the mild year-round San Diego climate. The De Soto Custom Team Apparel Program was announced in 2006. De Soto now offers a collection of their most popular garments customized with designs and graphics for teams as well as events. Every year there are hundreds of races, clubs, private, corporate, and university teams purchasing apparel with their unique graphics.",394923,Sporting & Athletic Goods NEC (Mfrs),339920,Sporting & Athletic Goods Manufacturing,15,,,,

The agreement enables Indium Corporation to offer a line of high-temperature, Pb-free ( lead-free ) assembly materials that addresses the requirements of many power semiconductor and semiconductor packaging applications. When Pb-free is a requirement, the only suitable high-temperature solder that exists is the AuSn eutectic alloy. These transient liquid phase sintering ( TLPS ) materials, which offer an alternative technology to solder, provide many of the assembly process advantages of a low-melting Pb-free solder combined with high temperature joint stability. Indium Corporation Global Product Manager Dr. Andy Mackie said, 'Ormet is leveraging Indium Corporations global sales and technical support capabilities to offer these products into the electronics assembly, passive component assembly, and semiconductor assembly markets. The Indium Corporation is leveraging Ormet's unique materials set. This combination ultimately benefits our customers and the marketplace. Ormet is gaining a valuable sales channel partner to introduce and deliver the next generation of assembly and interconnect materials to the electronics assembly industry, said James Haley Ormet's Vice President of Marketing and sales. Headquartered in San Diego, CA, Ormet Circuits, Inc was incorporated in 2003 to manufacture and market conductive pastes and inks for the printed circuit board fabrication and microelectronics industries. Ormet conductive materials find wide use in many electronic applications from radar antennas to semiconductor packages, complex circuit boards, and electronic components and assemblies. Indium Corporation is a premiere materials supplier to the global electronics, semiconductor, solar, thin film and thermal management markets. Products include solders, performs, and fluxes ; brazes ; sputter targets ; indium, gallium, and germanium chemicals and sourcing ; and Reactive NanoFoil. Founded in 1934, Indium has global technical support and factories located in China, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the USA. For more information about Ormet Circuits, Inc please visit www.ormetcircuits.com or email support@ormetcircuits.net. San Diego, CA.-- ( BUSINESS WIRE ) Ormet Circuits Inc has released its next RoHS compliant Z-Interconnect paste for use in multilayer printed wiring board structures. Ormet's Z interconnect pastes are used in Military, Telecommunications and network server boards, Personal Digital Assistants, RF assemblies and smart phones. Ormet 701 material provides designers and fabricators a powerful material and process solution enabling current PWB manufacturing processes to meet Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEM ) high-density designs with higher yield and reliability. The manufacturing improvements permitted by Ormet's materials promote limited lamination cyclesshortened production time, andreduced overall PWB costs. The Ormet paste extends the fabricators' toolbox for placing micro-vias in any layer at any location within the PWB. Ormet 701 is a transient liquid-phase sintered ( TLPS ) paste that is a composite metal and polymerbased material that undergoes dynamic structural changes during low-temperature heat treatment. During processing, a continuous metal network is created between the paste's metal particles and the adjoining metal layers in the multilayer substrate. The resulting metal network is highly electrically and thermally conductive and exhibits stable properties above 265 C.",289101,Adhesives & Glues-Manufacturers,325520,Adhesive Manufacturing,15,,,,

His Home Ranger Shoulder Pulley was so successful it has since become the best-selling home shoulder pulley on the market. This simple and effective device has set a standard in the industry. It is inexpensive, durable, easy to use and completely portable. Prior to its creation therapists had two options: they could either go down to their local hardware store, buy a pulley and some rope and make their own, or ask their patients to purchase one of the expensive clinical models. Spurred on by the success of the Home Ranger, Bill and co-founder Judy Ray began to create other products. In 1987 they formed PrePak Products. The company's growth over the years is a result of a steadfast commitment to customers and exceptional product quality. All products in PrePak's line are developed by therapists working in the field. You'll find practical, innovative products that help people recovering from shoulder, back, neck or knee injuries -- products that are useful not only for rehabilitation, but for general fitness as well. All of the home exercise devices come with illustrated, easy to understand instruction booklets.

Within a minute of a physician's uploading a patient's blood pressure measurement, Pulse Metric's patented analysis technologies produce a 16-point hemodynamic profile, including values for cardiac output, vessel compliance/distensibility, left ventricular contractility and systemic vascular resistance.
