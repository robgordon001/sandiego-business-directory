Our intense focus on developing a deep understanding of user needs, gives us powerful user insights that can be leveraged to achieve strategic goals for our clients. And because we have been exclusively in the online space for all these years, our knowledge pool is deeper. BusinessOnline has a cross-functional team of industry experts that are able to integrate search engine marketing (SEO, PPC), social media, user-experience, web design and development, and analytics into cohesive and measureable strategies that attract, engage, and drive consumers toward desired actions. We cannot stress that last part enough. Unless your customers actually DO something - something you want them to do - it's all a pointless exercise. And we make sure they do something in a way that ties directly back to your key business objectives. The definition of marketing success is different for every business. But, if there's one thing we've learned from working with thousands of clients - of all sizes, in all categories and markets - is that it all comes down to results. Our process begins with understanding your customers (can't overstate that), your competitors, your challenges, resources (both human and financial) and, most importantly, how you define success. At BusinessOnline, we take a truly integrated approach to your online presence, pulling in the right mix of experts - search marketing,, social media, and analytics - then we make sure we're all pursuing the same goal. We don't just launch a website, campaign or program, then stand back and hope it works. One thing we've learned is you're never done. Nothing's ever completed. So we're constantly measuring results and tracking your customer's behavior to improve results over time. We're always learning about your business and customers, and we're putting what we learn to use, to get better results. There's always something new to learn, if you're willing to find out what it is. 'With the help of BusinessOnline, we set aggressive goals and built a plan to achieve them. Once implemented, their recommendations enabled us to realize amazing results - we were able to prove marketing ROI through substantial increases in revenue, a reduction in user related service issues, and a boost in traffic for partners.

The laws change frequently and it is difficult to keep up, or to know which ones will affect  you and your taxes. At San Diego Tax Attorney Service, we understand this, and we try hard to stay on top of all the changes, so we can assist you in connecting with a tax professional who suits your needs.   Business taxes can be especially confusing. There are certain forms that must me filed, at certain times during the year, and if you miss a payment, you will be penalized harshly. One major penalty the IRS will add is the Trust Fund Recovery Penalty and it will double the amount you owe the IRS! This will make it even more difficult to pay back the taxes you owe. A form 941 is a report that you must file quarterly, and it basically tells the IRS the amount of earnings that are paid to your employees as well as the employers share of Social Security and Medicare Taxes and the employer withholding amounts. It is vital that this report gets filed on time, or you will be penalized. The form 940 is used to report your Annual Federal Tax Act, or FUTA, taxes. The FUTA tax, along with any state unemployment taxes, funds the unemployment benefits paid to people who are no longer employed.   If you have delinquent payroll taxes, or are having trouble filing any of your other employer taxes, contact San Diego Tax Attorney Service to discuss your options and be connected with a small business tax specialist.
